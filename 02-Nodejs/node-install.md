# Node.js installation

## NVM
* It is recommended to install Node.js using package manager such as `nvm` to manage different versions.
* Install nvm using script - `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`
* Above script will make some entries in .bash_profile file. So you need to close and open the terminal again.
* To see all the versions - `nvm ls-remote`
* Reference
